# An-agent-based-architecture-for-supporting-adaptability-in-a-workflow-environment
This project provides an architecture-based agent to manage adaptability in a workflow system. The proposed architecture is mainly composed of two types of agents: an agent manager and several user agents. The adaptation is validated in the workflow via rules called "adaptation rules". The system is implemented in the Java Agent DEvelopment Framework.
